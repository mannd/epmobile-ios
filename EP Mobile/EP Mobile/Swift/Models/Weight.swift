The Adjusted Body Weight formula here uses a correction factor of 0.4, which may give a more accurate measurement of Creatinine Clearance than other factors.  The formulas are not accurate if the height is less than 60 inches.\n\nPatients who are underweight (weight < Ideal Body Weight) should use actual weight for Creatinine Clearance determination.  Normal weight patients can use Ideal Body Weight, and overweight (defined in this calculator as weight 30% or more over Ideal Body Weight) should use the Adjusted Body Weight."
